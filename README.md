# 420 Project
Code for the 420 project that involves a LLM and whatever else the project requirements are.
Everything is found here!


To run the program you must have Python installed go Here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download and when you intall make sure to add Python to PATH when installing!!
You may need to also install the correct packages for Python that Visual Studio Code recommends if prompted!
Once Python is installed run 

```
python --version
```
To check your version then run.

```
pip install Flask
```
To install Flask to make the frontend and backend work together.

```
python app.py
```
To run and test out your program.

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
To get to website and to test your work. Its just localhost so whatever your's may be as this could be different!

Let me know if any help is needed!!!
